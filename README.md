# chrome-tab-number

Chrome allows to go to a specific tab using shortcut: CTRL/CMD + N, where N is a number between 1 and 8; 9 is reserved for the last tab. This extension make it easier by adding numbers to the page title.

This extension is based on the original version - [Tab Number](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-number/dnndfognablbihihgnilabcegjjkiekj) by Glen Murphy with some bug fixes.
